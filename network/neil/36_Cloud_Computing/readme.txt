Traditionnal IT Deployment Models
- On Premises solutions
- Colocation or ‘Colo’ services

Defining Cloud Computing
- National Institute of Standards and Technology : 'Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction'
- On-Demand Self-Service
- Rapid Elasticity
- Broad Network Access
- Ressources Pooling
- Measured Service

Server Virtualization
- Virtualization is one of the main enablers of Cloud Computing
- The cloud provider does not provision separate physical hardware for every customer
- Type 1 (Bare Metal) / Type 2 Hypervisors
- Containers are similar to virtual machines, but they virtualize software layers above the operating system level

Virualizing Network Devices
- Virtualization supports running multiple virtual systems on a single physical system
- Clustering supports combining multiple physical systems into a single virtual system

Cloud Service Models
- NIST define three Service Models of how cloud services can be offered : IaaS, PaaS, SaaS
- Data Center Stack : Data > Applications > Operating System > Hypervisor > Compute > Storage > Network > Facility
- On Premise : all, Colo : Facility and half Network, IaaS : from OS and above, PaaS : from Appication and above, SaaS : Data

Cloud Deployment Model
- NIST define four Cloud Deployment Models : Public, Private, Community, Hybrid
- Public : The cloud infrastructure is provisioned for open use by the general public
- Private : The cloud infrastructure is provisioned for exclusive use by a single organization comprising multiple consumers (e.g., business units)
- Community : The cloud infrastructure is provisioned for exclusive use by a specific community of consumers from organizations that have shared concerns
- Hybrid : The cloud infrastructure is a composition of two or more distinct cloud infrastructures (private, community, or public) that remain unique entities
- A company could also have Private Cloud at their main site and use Public Cloud for their Disaster Recovery location

Cloud Computing
- Scalability, Business Agility, Cost Efficiency, Competitive Advantage, Productivity, Availability and Reliability, Cost
